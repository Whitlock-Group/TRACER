# TRACKER
TRACKER is a useful toolbox for visualizing the trajectories of recording electrodes(e.g Neuropixels) through different sub-regions of the rat brain. Anatomical delineations are referenced from the Waxholm Space atlas of the adult Sprague Dawley rat brain (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/whs-sd-atlas). there are two packages in the TRACKER toolbox. One is for locating electrode tracks in the brain post-hoc using histological images, and the other is for generating coordinates prior to surgery in order to target specific brain regions. So happy tracking!
